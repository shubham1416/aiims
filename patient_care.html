	AIIMS strives hard to make world class clinical care available to millions of underprivileged citizens of India and neighboring countries. While its magnificent buildings and hi-tech facilities may create a superficial image of elitism, its corridors are thronged by patients, most of them too poor to afford quality treatment elsewhere. They come here with high hopes because of the reputation which AIIMS as built up. It has over 1500 spread over the main hospital, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic sciences, Cardiothoracic Centre, Neurosciences Centre, Institute Rotary Centre Hospital and De-addiction Centre. This complex of facilities caters to about 1.5 million outpatients and 80,000 inpatients every year .The number of surgical operations performed at AIIMS last year was over 100,000.</td>

	However, the strength of AIIMS lies not in numbers, but in availability under one roof of the best team of medical and surgical experts, state-of-the-art equipment, and our capacity to rise to the occasion to meet diagnostic or public health challenges.Be it the autoanalyser or the linear accelerator,magnetic resonance imaging or the gamma knife, AIIMS has them all.

	The role of AIIMS in patient care is not confined to our own hospital.AIIMS has trained physicians and surgeons who have fanned out across the country and abroad.For decades a large proportion of neurologists, neurosurgeons, cardiac surgeons, paediatric surgeons and gastroenterologists were from AIIMS,simply because we were the first to start courses in these superspecialities.New we have D M courses also in endocrinology and medical oncology.The nation has invested heavily in AIIMS from its doubt that AIIMS meager resources in an attempt to provide the best possible health care to its people irrespective of their paying capacity. Few would has fulfilled its commitment.</td>
